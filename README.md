# CapstoneArduino
2017 Capstone project-- Razer Chroma for an Arduino and RBG strips.
Version 1! Should work with any computer, and Arduino. 
Works with LED chips using WS2812, WS2811 and SK6812 drivers, like the Adafruit
Neopixel range of products

However, it is only tested on a Arduino Uno, and an Adafruit 8X8 Neopixel Panel.

You will also need to upload the provided .ino file to your arduino. To do so,
I'd recommend the [Arduino IDE](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/Software).
