# CapstoneArduino
2017 Capstone project-- Razer Chroma for an Arduino and RBG strips.
Version 1! Should work with any adafruit LED strip, and any computer and arduino. 

However, it is only tested on a Arduino Uno, and an Adafruit 8X8 Neopixel Panel.

You will also need to upload the provided .ino file to your arduino. To do so,
I'd recommend the [Arduino IDE](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/Software).
