- Possibly find a library that would allow for easy snap-connect GUI
- Update Design in order to include the secondary builder profile and an extra popup in the main as a helper for the Arduino half (LED length, white pixel, which pin it is connected to, etc)
- Main application should be able to provide code in order to program the Arduino, and links to the Aruino IDE website
- Backend properly sending serial comms to the Arduino.
- Find out performance penalty in the Arduino for Serial.isAvailable();
- Recode Arduino to return a byte when it finishes parsing a pattern, and to look for a kill byte:
		2^16-1 (2 bytes for pixel, all bits 1, no bits 0. 255 * 256
