V0.0.3: JavaFX initial creation
V0.0.4: Introduction of Gridpane to create a GUI
V0.0.5: A more complex, easy to manage GUI. Also stub class for managing GUI and backend
V0.0.6: Created an initialization dialouge to gather info from the user, implemented within the view. Also created a settings class to compliment this.
V0.0.7: Log directory chooser, logger, generalsettingsexception, small changes to mainviewdisplay, General quality of life improvements.
V0.0.8: ??? (something to do with refactoring the backend I believe)
V0.0.9: Improved initpopup to allow choosing a serial port, backend becomes more refined for the chosen form of serial communication (calling commands that reside on the arduino)
V0.0.9.5: InitPopup can now save/load settings, backend expanded. Refactored packages for better naming, Pattern classes collapsed from 3 to 2, no more LED and Pixel Classes, only LED renamed as Pixel.
V0.1.0 (CommDev): Massive reoganization, throwing out multiple classes in favor of a better structure that follows SRP and open-closed principles.
V0.1.1 (ColorExt): GUI can now control Arduino, SerialComms now static for easier passing between Patterns.
V0.2 (ProtoDuino): User selected color values with text boxes and sliders. The Prototype.
V0.2.1 (NeoPixPat): Added more patterns for the Arduino, all based upon the striptest example file given for neopixels. Pattern delays implemented. Implemented single color picking from the GUI.
V0.2.2 (SysError): Added a pattern that sends bytes to signal the arduino to clear its buffer, also a pattern showing memory used, and CPU usage.
V0.3 (RectDyn): Dynamic colors and delays for patterns, visualized with rectangles. Changed color of the background, pattern superclass works better. However, rectangles not tied in with backend, so project no longer works.
V0.3.1 (TiedRect): Fixed some bugs with color values on the rectangles, also the rectangles got tied into the pattern objects to provide colors and delays.
V0.9 (ExecuteAndListen): Added the ability for all patterns to detect key presses, and react by flashing a given color and time. Changed initial byte array for initializing patterns. Time pattern and CPU/Mem Patterns implemented.
V1.0 (PanelClear): Initialization and main windows cleaned up visually to look better. Named the Program Holonyak, after the inventor of the first visible light LED.

Roadmap:

V1.0: Init popup cleaned up (at least colors changed to match main GUI)
