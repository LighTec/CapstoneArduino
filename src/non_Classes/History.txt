V0.03: JavaFX initial creation
V0.04: Introduction of Gridpane to create a GUI
V0.05: A more complex, easy to manage GUI. Also stub class for managing GUI and backend
V0.06: Created an initialization dialouge to gather info from the user, implemented within the view. Also created a settings class to compliment this.
V0.07: Log directory chooser, logger, generalsettingsexception, small changes to mainviewdisplay, General quality of life improvements.
V0.08: ??? (something to do with refactoring the backend I believe)
V0.09: Improved initpopup to allow choosing a serial port, backend becomes more refined for the chosen form of serial communication (calling commands that reside on the arduino)
V0.095: InitPopup can now save/load settings, backend expanded. Refactored packages for better naming, Pattern classes collapsed from 3 to 2, no more LED and Pixel Classes, only LED renamed as Pixel.
V0.10 (CommDev): Massive reoganization, throwing out multiple classes in favor of a better structure that follows SRP and open-closed principles.
V0.11 (ColorExt): GUI can now control Arduino, SerialComms now static for easier passing between Patterns.
V0.2 (ProtoDuino): User selected color values with text boxes and sliders. The Prototype.
V0.21 (NeoPixPat): Added more patterns for the Arduino, all based upon the striptest example file given for neopixels. Pattern delays implemented. Implemented single color picking from the GUI.
V0.22 (SysError): Added a pattern that sends bytes to signal the arduino to clear its buffer, also a pattern showing memory used, and CPU usage.
V0.3 (RectDyn): Dynamic colors and delays for patterns, visualized with rectangles. Changed color of the background, pattern superclass works better. However, rectangles not tied in with backend, so project no longer works.

Roadmap:

(General roadmap)

V0.3 GUI cleanup
V0.9 Advanced Patterns
V1.0: Init popup cleaned up (at least colors changed to match main GUI)


(A more specific roadmap)

V0.9: Key Press pattern
V0.91: Date/Time pattern
V0.92: CPU/mem pattern
V1.0: Colors changed on the initialization pop-up, main GUI explicitly states delay and color rectangle panes
