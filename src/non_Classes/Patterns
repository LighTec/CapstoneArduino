NOTE: INDIVIDUAL LED'S ARE POINTS

DONE:

- All pixels one color

- Rainbow cycle, all pixels one color at a time

- A complete rainbow on the strip, moving

- Theater chase, 1 on 2 off with the on pixels moving down the line

- Rainbow cycle and theater chase combined

- Manual pixel change, singular

- Manual pixel change, all

TODO:

Waving pattern: x amount of points on the strip move along at y speed, having i 
and j colours between them, and have the colour between the points a 
mathematical average between them, with one colour more visible as it gets 
closer to the point.

Math.random at x interval to each LED, either a hard cut to it or a cycle.

Detection for applications to change patterns

Key presses cause a flash going x quick with a width of y.

Device battery life?


Text scrolling at x speed.

Matrix-type pattern with falling flashes of light with trails behind

Audio spectrum visualizer, low decibel frequencies start at x colour, then
once it gets louder morph to y colour and finally near max volume morph to z
colour.
