- Clean up the GUI
- Program detection to automatically load certain profiles
- Other sensor support
- Custom pattern creator within the GUI

- Changing colour based on system time
- Use a picture of the LED strip to make the demo for the pattern on the GUI look nice

- Rectangles represent colors, click in them to change color. When choosing a pattern, it will detect how many
rectangles to let appear on the GUI. Something similar with timer values.
